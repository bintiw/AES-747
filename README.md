# AES-747

AES.cs is a code for AES implementation.

AES.txt holds the text to be encrypted. After encryption, the result is stored in AES_result.txt and for decryption, AES_result.txt is taken as input and finally, AES_Plain.txt is generated.

There is also a prime number finder code (separate from AES code) that can list out the prime number up to 1000,000,000 using Sieve Algorithm.
